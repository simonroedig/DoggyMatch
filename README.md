# 🐾 DoggyMatch

DoggyMatch is a full-fledged **social networking app** I built with **Flutter** and **Firebase** that connects **dog owners** with **dog sitters**, and also helps owners connect with each other.  

I started this project as a way to **teach myself mobile app development** and explore how to build a cross-platform application from the ground up.  
What began as a learning project eventually became a **fully functional social media app** with working chats, posts, friends, and more.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists

DoggyMatch was never intended as a commercial release – it was a **learning playground** for me to dive deep into app development.  
Instead of keeping it private, I’ve made this repository public so that:
- Others can learn from a **complete social media app example** in Flutter  
- I can use it as a **reference project** for architecture and implementation patterns  
- It showcases my **technical growth** and exploration of Flutter + Firebase
